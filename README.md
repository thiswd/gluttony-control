# Gluttony Control API

This project was initiated using a custom Rails API template that I created. The template comes equipped with essential tools and configurations to expedite the development process.

## Initial Setup

### Docker Configuration

- The project is dockerized from the get-go, ensuring consistent environment for development.
- Containers have been set up for both the Rails API and the PostgreSQL database.

### Testing Tools

- **RSpec:** Chosen for its expressiveness and ease of use, RSpec is the primary testing tool for the project.
- **FactoryBot:** A fixture replacement to simplify object creation for tests.
- **Shoulda-Matchers:** Provides simple one-liner tests for common Rails functionalities, further speeding up the test-writing process.

### Code Quality and Standards

- **Rubocop:** Ensures the code adheres to community-driven Ruby coding standards.

## Design Decisions

### Database Choice

- **PostgreSQL:** Opted for a relational database due to my familiarity with such systems. PostgreSQL offers efficiency and a seamless integration with Rails.

### Future Implementations

This project is still in its infancy, and further refinements and features are in the pipeline. Stay tuned!
